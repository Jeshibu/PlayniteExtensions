One variation was that combining the first ending with the "Enduring Vigil" Achievement meant that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >neither the city, nor the fortress ever fell</span>, making it the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' data-format='R29sZGVuRW5kaW5n'>Golden Ending</a>.

The <em>Trespasser</em> DLC is a straighter example where choices made in the main game have a large impact here, and the Inquisition can become a political force, your former ally's personal army, or disband with the idea being they will be more secure but weaker, and whether the issue is resolved with diplomacy or aggression. Several of your companions also have different resolutions depending on how you handle them.

If you deliberately let the Council die, humanity becomes the <em>sole</em> species of the Council, with either Anderson or Udina as Chairman. if you choose to concentrate on Sovereign, which <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureToSaveMurder' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureToSaveMurder' data-format='W1tGYWlsdXJlVG9TYXZlTXVyZGVyIGluY2lkZW50YWxseV1d'>incidentally</a></em> leads to the Council's death, your ending will be decided by your <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter' data-format='S2FybWFNZXRlcg=='>Karma Meter</a>: If more Paragon, humanity will establish a new Council, with a human Chairman (either Anderson or Udina) leading a multi-species Council. If a Renegade, Udina will use your ruthlessness to lead humanity into ruling the galaxy with an entirely human Council.</span>
</li><li> Being a game with a heavy emphasis on player choice, even the <em>dungeons</em> in <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL01hc3NFZmZlY3Qx'>Mass Effect 1</a></em> can have slightly different endings depending on what order you tackle them in and the choices you make in each dungeon. A good example is in Noveria, where the boss fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Matriarch Benezia</span> will play out slightly differently depending on whether or not you have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Liara T'soni</span> in your party, whether your brought her along with you, and whether or not you choose to save or wipe out the Rachni. You also get an extra cutscene if you bring Wrex and decide to save the Rachni, where he chews you out for saving an obviously evil bug race that the krogan dedicated themselves to wiping out years ago. And all that is just in <em>the final act of one dungeon</em>. Let's not get started on <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode' data-format='W1tXaGFtRXBpc29kZSBWaXJtaXJlXV0='>Virmire</a>...
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL01hc3NFZmZlY3Qy'>Mass Effect 2</a></em> can literally range anywhere from <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave' data-format='RXZlcnlib2R5c0RlYWREYXZl'>Everybody's Dead, Dave</a> to the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' data-format='R29sZGVuRW5kaW5n'>Golden Ending</a> due to the absolutely deadly nature of the suicide mission. In addition, there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >keeping the Collector Base or not, sticking with Cerberus or not, the implications of not doing certain loyalty missions, particularly Samara's (which has your ending leave an immoral serial killer on the loose), etc.</span> Let's face it, the Mass Effect series and its game importing power take multiple endings to the point of <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation' data-format='U2VyaWFsRXNjYWxhdGlvbg=='>Serial Escalation</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly, <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked' data-format='Tm9DYW5vbkZvclRoZVdpY2tlZA=='>No Canon for the Wicked</a> could be considered to be inverted &#8212; if you start a new character in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, he/she will have made all the bad choices (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Wrex died, the council died, Shepard chose Udina rather than Anderson, the Rachni were wiped out &#8212; the only highly significant one that may turn out 'as expected' is that Shepard will save Kaiden if female and Ashley if male</span>). This led to many people starting from Mass Effect 2 to either import someone else's character with the desired decisions, or use a save editor to create the character they want. As discussed on <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches' data-format='Q3V0dGluZ09mZlRoZUJyYW5jaGVz'>Cutting Off the Branches</a>, some fans speculate this is a sneaky way of encouraging players to play the first game instead of jumping into the sequel blind. On the other hand, the <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>PS3</span> version, due to the first game never being released for that system, includes an interactive comic book that allows the players to make decisions about major events.

<ul ><li> It should be noted that, aside from the first game, you actually have to put effort in to get a normal or bad end, such as killing over 100 team members in combat, while the true end is given by default. In the first game, killing <em>any</em> team member, even by accident, locks you out of the true ending. The game does not tell you this. As the series evolved, the other endings have come to rely less on team kills, to the point that the fourth game doesn't bother to track them. (The alternate endings are instead defined by play-set relationships to the protagonist, defeating bonus bosses, or being at a set level.)

<ul ><li> Worst ending: This ending is achieved by dying to the final boss, Purity of Odio. After the last party member dies, Odio casts "Armageddon", which destroys the world across all of the time periods in the game. This ending is also achievable if the player chooses to play as Oersted in the Final Chapter and manually casts "Armageddon".
</li><li> Villain's ending: Achieved by completing the Final Chapter as Oersted without casting "Armageddon". Having completely won, Odio is left with nothing more than a lifeless world as his final prize.

While Odio is dead, the heroes are trapped in his desolate timeline, unable to return home. In addition, it is suggested that the cycle of violence and destruction Odio put into motion will continue...
</li><li> Good ending: Achieved by defeating Purity of Odio, then walking away from him. Upon returning to the chamber with statues of his various incarnations throughout time, Odio makes another attempt on the heroes' lives by forcing them to fight against his various forms. After winning against Odio's forms again, Odio passes away, but warns the heroes that another Lord of Dark will arrive in time. When he finally dies, the heroes return back to their proper places in time &#8212; and in the original 1994 version, the ending sequence shows their exploits in the days since &#8212;.
</li><li> Best ending (added in the 2022 remake): Achieved in the same way as the good ending, but only if the player finds every hero in the Final Chapter. Driven mad by the heroes' perseverance, Odio goes <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel' data-format='T25lV2luZ2VkQW5nZWw='>One-Winged Angel</a>.

Ultimately, Oersted manages to wrest himself free from Odio's control and strike the final blow, reclaiming his humanity in so doing. In reply to Oersted's final words, the heroes affirm that they will look to the future with optimism. After the heroes return home, the game shows their exploits in the days since: Pogo becomes a father after Beru gives birth to their child, the new Earthen Heart Shifu continues to pass on their knowledge to new pupils, Oboromaru continues to perserve the peace of Japan from the shadows, the Sundown Kid continues to wander throughout the Wild West, Masaru sets off to continue his journey to become the strongest fighter, Akira continues to assist Doc Tobei in his scientific experiments, and Cube continues to travel with his builder Kato through the cosmos.

Aya rises up from her seat and the camera cuts to the stage to show the whole audience with glowing eyes.

The standard ending shows a black screen with the President talking to his aide over the events of the end of the game. The good ending shows an extended version of this with the President and his aide in the picture as they also discuss on what to do with the mole they sent.

<ul ><li> The "Good" ending entails commanding the Netherbrain to destroy itself, along with the illithid tadpoles under its command. With the threat to Faerun destroyed, Baldur's Gate begins to recover. Choosing this ending leads to a <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' data-format='UGxheWFibGVFcGlsb2d1ZQ=='>Playable Epilogue</a> where the surviving characters reunite a few months later and catch up with one another.
<ul ><li> A variant of the "Good" ending entails allowing Gale to use the Netherese Orb to destroy the Netherbrain, sacrificing himself in so doing. Since he teleports you and your other companions out of harm's way beforehand, this still leads to the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' data-format='UGxheWFibGVFcGlsb2d1ZQ=='>Playable Epilogue</a>, but with one notable change: Gale's absence (save for an astrally-projected message he leaves behind, explaining that the orb has left him <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead' data-format='RGVhZGVyVGhhbkRlYWQ='>Deader than Dead</a>).
</li><li> Another variant of the "Good" ending follows your transformation into a mind flayer. With this, you have the option to continue on (with variations depending on whether you like the power you have, trust that things will work out, or be prepared to end your life if you're about to lose control), submit yourself to imprisonment to protect others from you, or kill yourself to prevent any harm you may end up inflicting as a mind flayer.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Bad" ending entails assuming control over the Netherbrain instead of destroying it, becoming the Absolute in so doing. Whatever allies haven't died will be brought under your control via the Netherbrain, and you will go on to conquer Faerun. This precludes the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue' data-format='UGxheWFibGVFcGlsb2d1ZQ=='>Playable Epilogue</a>.

</li><li> Dark Urge players have a unique variation on the "Good" ending, depending on whether they broke free of Bhaal's influence.
<ul ><li> A Dark Urge player who succeeded in rejecting Bhaal will appear to die by Bhaal's hand, but be subsequently resurrected by Withers, now free of the Dark Urge. From there, the game continues as normal.
</li><li> A Dark Urge player who did not succeed in rejecting Bhaal will invoke their god's wrath and continue to suffer from the influence of the Urge. They will eventually be imprisoned, and Withers will visit them and remind them that even though they may be a slave to Bhaal's influence, they still saved the world, and to take pride in at least that much.

The first game has an extra (bad) ending where you defeat the final boss without revealing her true form first. The second game not only has a bad ending, it has a "best" ending which relies on an earlier boss fight. The third game also has a bad ending, and the fourth game lets you side with the villain and fight your former party members.

<ul ><li> "Ending 1: Playing It By the Book" requires the player to defeat Lord Doldrum without triggering any other ending condition. The people of Somewhere simply celebrate Doldrum's defeat in the most generic way possible.
</li><li> "Ending 2: A Complete Waste of My Time" requires the player to leave the Somewhere throne room without talking to the queen. Hero man decides that the quest to defeat Doldrum isn't worth his time.
</li><li> "Ending 3: The Impractical Treasure Hunter" requires the player to jump down the well. The well is bottomless, so Hero Man is doomed to fall forever.
</li><li> "Ending 4: Self-Imposed Challenges" requires the player to buy the expensive Fire Sword from the first weapon shop. The narrator mocks the player for spending so much time grinding for an overpowered weapon at the start of the game and forces them to teleport to Doldrum's castle. Doldrum himself is instantly killed in the cutscene.
</li><li> "Ending 5: Key Hoarder" requires the player to buy the first key from the thief, go into the Sign Maker's basement, and buy the second key. This causes Hero Man to be incriminated as a thief after he defeats Doldrum, and he's tossed in prison.
</li><li> "Ending 6: Hero and Detective" requires the player to buy the first key from the thief, go into the Sign Maker's basement, and refuse to buy the second key. The thief ends up being caught for stealing the Sign Maker's keys.
</li><li> "Ending 7: My Own Hero" requires the player to steal the prince's key and go into the Tower without him. Hero Man regrets pushing people away and resolves to be a better friend to others in his next journey, but the warp at the top of the Tower traps him on an isolated island.
</li><li> "Ending 8: Hero Man the Worthless" requires the player to agree to work with the prince and to clear the Tower. The prince gets to Lord Doldrum first, who kills himself because he can't stand how pathetic the prince is. The prince ends up taking all the credit for saving the world while Hero Man is seen as useless.
</li><li> "Ending 9: I'm Not a Babysitter" requires the player to agree to work for the prince, but then go to a non-Tower dungeon without him. This results in the prince dying of his wounds in the Crossroads, and the queendom arrests Hero Man for killing the prince.
</li><li> "Ending 10: Inn-Security" requires the player to stay at the inn five times. After the fifth stay, Lord Doldrum destroys Somewhere due to Hero Man taking too long to defeat him.
</li><li> "Ending 11: Ultimate Power" requires the player to beat Doldrum at level 12 or higher. Hero Man goes mad with his unmatched power and becomes Demond Lord Man.
</li><li> "Ending 12: One Man Army" requires the player to beat Doldrum with only Hero Man. Hero Man becomes arrogant from his solo victory and walks out of the castle because he feels that he's superior to everyone in Somewhere, only for him to fall into the moat and drown.
</li><li> "Ending 13: Never Go the Extra Mile" requires the player to beat Doldrum at level 3 or lower. Although Hero Man thinks this low level run is worthy of recognition, he is disillusioned that no one cares about this feat beyond the Demon Lord being slain.
</li><li> "Ending 14: A Disappointing Sequence Break" requires the player to obtain the Legend Sword without getting the hint from the Sign Maker. This somehow traps the party in Lord Doldrum's throne room forever.
</li><li> "Ending 15: No Need for a Savior" requires the player to capture and sell a Diamond Oozie. Hero Man decides that he's rich enough to retire and ditches the quest, but Lord Doldrum destroys the world anyways.
</li><li> "Ending 16: Underqualified Hero" requires the player to lose to Lord Doldrum, who is pleasantly surprised that he won despite being considered an easy boss in-universe.
</li><li> "Ending 17: Condescending Narrative" requires the player to refuse to start a new loop, causing the game to send Hero Man to a small room while trying to guilt trip the player into picking up the game again.
</li><li> "Final Ending: Freedom" requires the player to see all other endings and enter the big door in the Crossroads. Hero Man ends up finding an empty room and is initially disappointed, but realizes that all his brief and meaningless adventures may have happened for a greater purpose, causing a path to spawn. He walks on a bridge through the sky and thinks about how much he can appreciate the world outside of the RPG quest.

This option can be selected alongside the base game's endings when you speak with Johnny over Misty's Esoterica, but uniquely, you can also trigger this ending early by calling Solomon Reed at any time after finishing the <em>PL</em> storyline.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the DLC has its own four endings, themed after the Kings of the four Tarot suits. The first branching point takes place in the penultimate story mission, "Firestarter", where V must choose to betray Reed or Song So Mi, resulting in completely different final missions: "Killing Moon" takes place if you betray Reed and sees you storming the spaceport to help Song escape on a Moon-bound shuttle, while "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos" and "Somewhat Damaged" occur otherwise, where you raid a <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded' data-format='W1tUaGVEcmVhZGVkIE1heFRhY11d'>MaxTac</a> convoy to free Song, then chase her to an abandoned underground Cynosure bunker to stop her from merging with the Blackwall <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>AIs</span>. The four endings are then:
<ul ><li> "King of Wands" takes place if you successfully send Song to the Moon, killing Reed to protect her, but Alex is still alive and leaves Night City amicably. In a follow-up mini-mission, "From Her to Eternity", it is indicated that Song's surgery was a success, too.
</li><li> "King of Swords" occurs if you hand Song (who has just admitted to duping you) off to Reed at the spaceport in return for a cure. Reed and Alex both survive, but Song suffers a <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfPersonality' data-format='RGVhdGhPZlBlcnNvbmFsaXR5'>Death of Personality</a>, and you unlock "The Tower" ending for the main game.
</li><li> "King of Cups" takes place if you decide to <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill' data-format='TWVyY3lLaWxs'>Mercy Kill</a> Song in the Cynosure bunker. Reed survives, but Alex is dead (killed by Hansen in "Firestarter"), and Myers denies you treatment.
</li><li> "King of Pentacles" occurs if you knock Song out and take her out of the bunker. All but Song's personality and Alex survive, and Myers gives you a medal and sponsors your treatment, unlocking "The Tower" ending.

The Master then fuses Plutomon to itself to become stronger. Upon defeating Plutomon, the kids will then notice that the portal connecting the two worlds is getting bigger and cannot be closed anymore. This will lead to the two worlds fusing together and the human world being thrust into chaos and destruction, with only a handful of children being able to maintain a bond with their Digimon. Kaito and Takuma take it upon themselves to find these children and recruit them, in the hopes that they'll soon be able to convince the world that Digimon and humans can live side-by-side.</span>

The kids suggest that the sheer acknowledgement and belief of the people from Earth will keep the Digital World from collapsing. The humans head back home to spread the word of the Digital World, but their partners decide to stay in the Digital World as they deem that Earth may not be ready for them yet.

However, Piedmon's personality is the dominant one, which leads to Boltboutamon absorbing Kaito and then trying to take control of the Master. The heroes beat him, but he ended up merging both worlds in the process, and they also lose the Professor and Miyuki along the way.

<ul ><li> In the <strong>Elden Lord</strong> endings, the Tarnished reforges the Elden Ring and becomes Marika's consort, though how depends on what Mending Rune was used:
<ul ><li> <strong>Age of Fracture</strong>: The Tarnished becomes Elden Lord in defiance of the gods, fracturing the established order created by Marika and replacing it with their own. The skyline still glows a golden hue, while the Erdtree glows silver.
</li><li> <strong>Age of Duskborn</strong>: The Elden Ring is reforged using Fia's Mending Rune of the Death-Prince. A new order is made where "life in death" is part of the natural world, and those who live in death are no longer persecuted. The skyline still glows a golden hue, but is obscured by a "rain" of ash.
</li><li> <strong>Age of Order</strong>: The Elden Ring is reforged using Goldmask's Mending Rune of Perfect Order. The Golden Order is "perfected" and removed from the influence of gods. The skyline still has its golden hue, but the Erdtree itself is also glowing gold.
</li><li> <strong>Blessing of Despair</strong>: The Elden Ring is reforged with the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse, obtained by completing the Dung Eater's associated quest line. The Erdtree still glows silver, but skyline is obscured by vile, fallstreak hole riddled brown clouds and a brown fog falls across the land. The Rune of the Fell Curse ensures all born in this age will be forever afflicted by the Seedbed Curse, from their children to their grandchildren and so on for eternity.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Age of Stars</strong>: The Tarnished helps Ranni achieve her goal of usurping Marika as god emperor under the patronage of the Dark Moon, and becomes her consort. She declares she will start a thousand-year journey into "fear, doubt, and loneliness", and moves her new order into the void beyond the lands between. She also intends to get rid of "all those who came before", implied to be the other outer gods.
</li><li> <strong>Lord of Frenzied Flame</strong>: The Tarnished becomes the avatar of the Frenzied Flame, destroying what remains of queen Marika and burning the Erdtree before leaving to set fire to the rest of the world. Melina picks up Torrent's summoning whistle and swears to hunt down the Tarnished and deliver them "destined death".

<ul ><li> For example, in the SNES version of the second game, <em>Der Langrisser</em>, there are four basic story paths: Light, Imperial, Chaos, and Independent, each involving the main character Erwin joining one of three factions (the Light Army of Kalxath, the Rayguard Empire, or the forces of Chaos) or turning his back on all three, each featuring a different roster of playable allies (most of whom can also be enemy characters on other paths), and each leading to a different epilogue.
</li><li> Even within each of the four possible story paths, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of possible permutations of epilogues for the characters involved. The individual character epilogues depend on whether the characters reached their highest class change, how many enemy units they killed, how many times they were reduced to 0 HP, and so on &#8212; if they were particularly active in the battles, they go on to greatness throughout their lives, whereas if they were frequently reduced to 0 HP or sat at the back and did nothing, they fade into obscurity after the events of the game.

For Jinkuro, this isn't a particulary good deal, since the reason he used the body possession skill to begin with was because his own body was close to dying anyway... which he does soon afterwards. However, it is heavily implied that he took over Yukinojo's body before he died to be married to Momohime. Between him acting differently, all of a sudden disagreeing with his father, and naming his "new" fighting style (which is actually just Oboro style) Izuna style, Izuna being Jinkuro's last name. In the end he fooled EVERYONE, even most gamers. Not bad for an old guy.</span> DLC characters get two each.

<ul ><li> The <em>Neptunia</em> series has multiple endings in just about every game, most of which are of the simple "Normal Ending and True Ending" variety, but <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperDimensionNeptuniamk2' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperDimensionNeptuniamk2' data-format='W1tWaWRlb0dhbWUvSHlwZXJEaW1lbnNpb25OZXB0dW5pYW1rMiBIeXBlcmRpbWVuc2lvbiBOZXB0dW5pYSBtazJdXQ=='>Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2</a> and its remake have the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker' data-format='W1tUZWFySmVya2VyIENvbnF1ZXN0XV0='>Conquest</a> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding' data-format='W1tFYXJuWW91ckJhZEVuZGluZyBFbmRpbmddXQ=='>Ending</a>.

For the ending itself, though, there are only two options. A good or neutral PC defeats the King of Shadows, then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" ><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies' data-format='Um9ja3NGYWxsRXZlcnlvbmVEaWVz'>Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a></span>. An evil PC may instead choose to side with the King of Shadows and terrorize the Sword Coast, though the sequel assumes that the player picked the good ending.
<ul ><li> The sequel/expansion pack provides a far more interesting array of different endings concerning both the PC's fate and that of his/her companions. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >if you gathered all of the Mask Fragments, you can get the ultimate good ending and put Akachi's soul to rest while also freeing yourself and the land of the curse. Regardless of whether or not you have the mask pieces, you can choose the selfish ending and rid yourself of the curse, but leave it free to continue plaguing Rashemen. If you failed to collect the Mask Fragments, you may choose the completely selfless ending, locking the curse inside yourself and eternally staying in the City of Judgment to contain it, praised as a hero, but forever trapped. Or, there's the ultra-evil approach; bending the curse to your will to become an unstoppable god-killing abomination with all of the benefits of the curse but none of the drawbacks. Similarly, the endings for your companions vary depending on both your choices in the game and the actual influence with them. For example, if you've pursued a romance, your beloved may choose to stay with you in the City of Judgment in the selfless scenario. At the other end of the spectrum, you may reach the end of the story with all of your companions dead by your hand.</span>
</li><li> The second expansion, "Storm of Zehir", has a similar conclusion if you've played the main quest to the end, showing the fates of your companions and the towns you visited according to your actions. Unusually, after seeing this, you can Bluff or Intimidate the storyteller into giving the different endings by telling him how to set each variable. This even extends to companions you never actually recruited (or even encountered, since several are found randomly wandering the world map) and side-quests you never found out about.

Aside from them, there are three main endings: two that depend on whether you side with Welles or the Board, and one joke ending.
<ul ><li> <strong>Siding with Welles</strong>: The Board has been driven from the Halcyon system, and the scientists on the <em>Hope</em> have been revived. Unable to return to Earth, the colonists band together and, through some hardship, manage to turn the system into a thriving colony.
</li><li> <strong>Siding with the Board</strong>: With rebellion against them crushed, the Board exert their power to essentially enslave the entire population of Halcyon. The original colonists on the <em>Hope</em> are jettisoned to make way for new workers, nearly all of the current colonists are ordered into stasis chambers and subsequently abandoned, and the settlements of Halcyon eventually became ghost towns (except for Byzantium, the Board's seat of power on Terra 2).

If Syanna survives (either by Geralt summoning Dettlaff by speaking to the Unseen Elder or by retrieving her ribbon in the Land of the Thousand Fables), the duchess honors Geralt by bestowing upon him the Order of Vitis Vinifera, but Syanna murders her during the ceremony only to be shot by Damien de la Tour. This may be averted if Geralt had found Syanna in the Land of the Thousand Fables, learnt her story from her journal and herself, learns before the ceremony that Anna Henrietta was intended to be Syanna's final victim, and can convince her to forgive her: in this scenario, the sisters embrace as Toussaint celebrates.</span>

He's defeated by the Demon Lord and is launched all the way to the weapon shop. He decides to take his quest more seriously and thanks Weaco for inspiring him to apply himself. While he still isn't successful in beating the Demon Lord, he does spread word of Weaco and Ponmi's shop, causing their business to boom further.
</li><li> Ending 3 can be obtained by defeating the Demon Lord. Schivardi is angered that Weaco is gaining the fame that he wanted for defeating the Demon Lord, and threatens to kill Ponmi unless Weaco surrenders the title of Demon Lord Slayer to him. Weaco remembers the Demon Lord's words about humanity becoming complacent and needing a moral compass, and proceeds to talk some sense into Schivardi. She and Ponmi start a religion to guide people in the right direction, which also has the convenient side effect of getting them donations for their shop.

Demon Lord Dolhabach will be concerned about the disappearance of life on the island and asks Weaco to sell or discard everyone to restore them to their rightful place. If she refuses, Dolhabach will fight her in order to save everyone. After the battle, Weaco looks upon the lifeless wasteland that she created and thinks to herself, "I messed up!"

It's possible for one to obtain a happy ending while surrounded by disaster, or for the village to thrive once more only for its heroes to still meet bittersweet or outright tragic ends... among many other possibilities.
