In the game, each character may have either one ally (Maya), one enemy (TJ Combo, Glacius, Sabrewulf, Spinal, and Kim Wu), an ally and an enemy (Jago, Orchid, and Tusk), or even two enemies (Fulgore). Basically, whether or not a fatal move is performed (or if the background is interactive) on a specific character decides the ending; you obviously would want to kill your enemy while leaving any allies alive for the better endings.
<ul ><li> For one straightforward example, if the player beats the game playing as TJ Combo, if Tusk is alive, TJ Combo sees there is a possibility to rebuild his name in the past, so he foregoes returning back to the present and becomes a champion. If Tusk is dead, Combo is convinced there are no possible challengers, returns to the present, and starts to rebuild his boxing career.
</li><li> A more complicated example is Orchid: Her ally is Jago and her enemy is Sabrewulf. If Jago is alive but Sabrewulf is dead, on his deathbed Gargos reveals Jago and Orchid are siblings and they form a fighting team. If Jago is dead and Sabrewulf is dead, Orchid lives but mourns the fact that she murdered Jago. If Jago is alive and Sabrewulf is alive, Gargos possesses Sabrewulf and attacks, but Jago successfully kills the demon. If Jago is dead but Sabrewulf is alive, Gargos possesses Sabrewulf and attacks Orchid off-guard; she dies and Gargos gets his revenge.
</li><li> Not all the characters' endings are happy though; some are just less than others. If playing as Spinal, if Kim Wu is alive, he dies; but if Kim Wu is dead, he simply is left to an eternity alone without purpose.

To get the true ending, you must keep things balanced by alternating defeating light and dark forces, freeing Master Hand and Crazy Hand in the process, using Master Hand to beat up a horde of puppet fighters, and then ascending a long staircase and going through a <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush' data-format='Qm9zc1J1c2g='>Boss Rush</a> of all previous boss characters before <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss' data-format='W1tEdWFsQm9zcyBmaWdodGluZyBib3RoIGV2aWwgZW50aXRpZXMgYXQgb25jZV1d'>fighting both evil entities at once</a>.

</li><li> Before the final mission in <em>World at War</em>, Reznov will read a passage from Chernov's diary. If the player went and slaughtered helpless Germans during the Soviet campaign, the passages will be critical; if the player spared them, the passages will praise the player. If the player did a mixture of both, the passages will paint the character as a moral question mark. The actual logic behind the morality of the choices is a bit difficult to understand, though, as your choices involve mercy-killing a group of mortally wounded Germans who are writhing in pain as they bleed out, or gunning down a group that are about to be burnt alive anyway by several vengeful Russians wielding molotov cocktails.

If the scientist Karma is even rescued, her survival while on the USS <em>Obama</em> depends on whether, in the previous mission, deep-cover agent Farid keeps his cover by killing Harper (wherein he will be on the Obama to save her when the bridge is taken) or takes his chance to kill Menendez there (wherein he dies, but Harper lives), and also affects whether the Celerium worm is successfully flushed out of the entire network system. The <em>Obama</em> itself is lost or saved depending on whether you choose to kill Admiral Briggs or not and whether you completed all of the Strike Force missions, wherein the <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper' data-format='R2VuZXJhbFJpcHBlcg=='>General Ripper</a> leading the SDC's military in their Cold War against the US is killed and China allies themselves with the US.

Conversely, if you choose the former, Bell will betray Perseus and tell Adler about his hideout in the Solovetsky Monastery: the attack was a success, but Perseus managed to escape justice, all while the Soviet government is in disarray and confusion, implying that Perseus and his organization are acting on their own accord without the approval of their higher-ups. Even if Bell earns the CIA team's trust for their contribution, that still doesn't stop Adler from deciding to execute Bell for being a loose end.

If you rescued fewer than that, they let you die (Standard Bad). If you rescued all 99, you get the Standard Good ending, but also a teaser for the next game and some production art (Perfect Good). If you killed as many mudokons as possible (some mudokons must be rescued in order to progress in the game), you are appointed Head of Employee Relations by the baddies (Perfect Bad).

<ul ><li> The first is Temple of Ikov, which has you choose late into the quest whether to side with Lucien, who gave you the quest to get the Staff of Armadyl, or the Guardians of Armadyl, who guard the staff left behind by their god. If you side with Lucien, you just kill the Guardians and bring the staff to him to complete the quest. If you side with the Guardians, they give you a pendant to resist his mind manipulation and you kill him. Regardless of what you pick, he ultimately ends up being alive and with the staff.
</li><li> The second is Hazeel Cult, which has you either infiltrate the cult or join it for real. Infiltrating does basically nothing but get you the armour the quest giver, Ceril, asks you to return to him and gives a reward of five gold. Joining it has you learn about the cult's and Ceril's history (Ceril's ancestor was part of a group of Saradominists that invaded Ardogune, and he personally killed Hazeel and stole his mansion) and work to revive Hazeel using a scroll Ceril has. Your reward for reviving him is 2000 gold, Hazeel's personal thanks, an offer to join him while he waits to regain his power (which you refuse, to his dismay and understanding), and a mention that he will one day return. Unsurprisingly, aiding Ceril isn't considered properly completing the quest, despite the quest log saying it's finished, as the reward scroll says you ...kind of... completed Hazeel Cult when he gives you your reward.

Aboard the ARK, Shadow, having finally let go of his tormented past, says goodbye to his old self, discards his photo of Maria and Prof. Robotnik, and walks off. While the Last Way takes place in the area of the hero endings, after you've collected all the Chaos Emeralds, none of them <em>quite</em> match up with the situation at the beginning of the Last Story.

<ul ><li> The first ending occurs if you get less than 20,000 points before running out of lives. Irisu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >murders the other three characters, then retreats back to her room to watch a news story covering their disappearance</span>.

</li><li> <strong>The Old Life Returns</strong>: The Faction, a group of traitors within the League, makes a deal with the Empire, allowing them to live in comfort and luxury while plundering colony worlds of their resources for Earth after claiming a false victory. The League is crippled, and several key members are executed, with only a handful escaping the Empire's clutches.
</li><li> <strong>The Caucus for Peace</strong>: After defeating the Faction, the League is unable to claim a decisive victory over the Empire. At the same time, the Empire's fleet becomes to thinly spread to deal with the League without risking control over their worlds. In the end, both sides come to an agreement: in exchange for providing aid to Sol, the League would be granted its independence from the Empire.
</li><li> <strong>A Slow, Lingering Death</strong>: The League is forced to retreat from Sol, but as they fell back, they sealed the Warp Hole that allowed the Empire to spread out beyond the Sol system. Now cut off from the rest of the galaxy, unable to collect any of the resources from the colonies, the Empire begins to fall to civil war as its citizens fight over what scraps remain. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vih9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5vih9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vih9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This ending is considered canon and leads into the events of <em>Colony Wars: Vengeance</em>.</span>

With the Tzar missing afterwards, the people of Earth begin to scatter across the galaxy as both the League and Empire dissolve.

While Synedrion grows to accept the new status quo even if it isn't quite the future they envisioned, New Jericho is insistent on a return to the old ways and fights on to the bitter end - and soon the last remaining part of the old Earth is extinguished. While they may be unrecognizable from their old forms, the human race keeps its soul and individual thought and moves forward into a bold new age of biological transhumanism with the Exalted gently guiding their way.</span>

Earth falls into darkness, and is lost forever.

</li></ul></li><li> If Mario successfully evaded <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Ghost Peach</span>, the player reappears in the forest <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >controlling Peach</span>. At this point, there are two outcomes for the following event:
<ul ><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >If Peach wanders to the end, she eventually comes across a pit, but is forced to walk towards it against her will while a ghostly silhouette watches on and taunts her. After she falls, the game seemingly resets and the player is Mario once again, but this time the forest has a reddish hue. As Mario proceeds forward, the screen blanks out and then reappears with him standing before a pool of blood while a dramatic <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord' data-format='U2NhcmVDaG9yZA=='>Scare Chord</a> sounds out. At this point, the game becomes softlocked, but if the player holds down the R button, the screen briefly scrolls over to a ghoulish Peach with "I WATCH" written in blood below her</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >If Peach killed all of the Rexes, the disembodied voice suggests that she'd "go back and show THEM". If she does so, however, part of a bridge collapses and plunges her into the water, at which point the game abruptly and seemingly resets. (If she continues forward instead, the previous ending with the pit will play.) However, when the player re-enters the level, Mario is shown falling through a hole and eventually onto a platform in the trees in an underwater-like environment. Mario is tasked by the disembodied voice with removing weeds and gathering wood to build the treehouse/cabin seen in the first ending above, and each time Mario completes one part of the task he is shown falling through the hole again while the disembodied voice shows delight. When the house is complete, Mario is shown falling one more time, but as he falls through the hole in the roof, the screen cuts to black and the game softlocks, forcing the player to reset manually. It's slightly implied that this ending takes place sometime before the game, as the player can come across the cabin with Mario's corpse in it prior to this ending. In addition, the above scene of events happens again in the secret forest ending, only this time there is a second Mario standing in the place you'd land.</span>

</li><li> Normal Ending (Ranks D,C,B,A,S): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Ryoba is found innocent of murder (with how much people believe that to be true depending on the rank), but, having her dreams of confessing to Jokichi ruined by her arrest and trial, she kidnaps him instead.</span>
</li><li> S+ Ending/True Ending: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >By eliminating the rivals the 'canonical' way (hinted at by Ryoba's monologues before each week), an extra scene is added to the Normal Ending in which Saikou Corp. kidnaps Jokichi in order to talk to Ryoba about...something.</span>
</li><li> Happy Ending: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >By creating a time paradox and following FUN GIRL's instructions, namely driving Ui away so she doesn't see Ryoba acting suspicious and eliminating the first nine rivals non-fatally, Ryoba is never suspected of Sumire's murder, the tenth rival never comes to Akademi, and Ryoba gets the courage to confess to Jokichi.</span>
</li><li> Genocide Ending: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >By killing everyone but Jokichi on the first day of school, there's no one to stop Ryoba from kidnapping him right then and there.</span> Notably, at this time this is also the only ending implemented for 20XX Mode.

Since The Ride was the first of the Jack games to not feature randomly-selected questions, the game knows when it has run out, and, in addition to the semblances of plot building up to The Bottom, the game presents you with a video scene of the five hosts talking with each other, before they offer you a choice of what sort of ending you want.

</li><li> Ending 3: Urotsuki jumps off the stairs on her balcony, but then it's revealed she was a doll in a claw machine all along. A little girl takes her home.
