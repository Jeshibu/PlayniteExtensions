He can either save Harvey, but allow Catwoman to come to harm and damage her trust in him; or save Catwoman, but let the Penguin maim Harvey's face.</li><li> Season 1, episode 4: Batman is facing a war on two fronts. Harvey Dent, having become Two-Face, is preparing to lay siege to Wayne Manor while the Penguin is hacking into his tech, potentially risking his secrets. Whomever he chooses to confront at that moment as Batman, he will need to contend with the other as Bruce when the next episode begins.</li><li> Season 2, episode 2: Bruce is forced to decide who to aid while going undercover in the Pact when they and the Agency have it out, either Harley Quinn or Bane. Whoever he chooses to aid, the other will be left to contend with the Agency's forces while the others make their escape.</li><li> Season 2, episode 3: Harley Quinn knows someone absconded with the Riddler's laptop, and her suspicions are narrowed down to Bruce and Catwoman. Bruce has two choices: on the one hand, he can sell Catwoman out, maintaining his cover and allowing him to stay close to the Pact while she is left in one of Riddler's torture chambers. On the other hand, he can protect Catwoman by admitting to stealing the laptop, resulting in him being locked in one of Mr. Freeze's cryochambers as his cover is blown.</li><li> Season 2, episode 4: At the end of the episode, John Doe becomes the Joker. What kind of Joker he becomes depends on how Bruce treated him: if treated with suspicion and mistrust, he becomes a Villain who sides with Harley. If treated with kindness and trust, however, he becomes a Batman-inspired Vigilante who rebels against Harley.</li><li> Season 2, episode 5: After the troubling events of the season caused him to question the righteousness of their cause, Alfred makes the decision to leave Bruce's employ. The player is presented with two choices: allow Alfred to leave and continue to fight as Batman, or give up the mantle of Batman to keep Alfred at their side. <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger' data-format='VGhlU3Rpbmdlcg=='>The Stinger</a> also differs depending on how the player treated John Doe.</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BestOfThree' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BestOfThree' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL0Jlc3RPZlRocmVl'>Best of Three</a></em>: The game has a variety of different endings based on what you say to Grant and if you admit to having written the notebook of poetry about him.

If he chooses to kill the villain, however, she takes him with her to her death.</li><li> <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiversTwoHarvestOfSouls' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiversTwoHarvestOfSouls' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL1NoaXZlcnNUd29IYXJ2ZXN0T2ZTb3Vscw=='>Shivers Two: Harvest of Souls</a></em> gives the player the choice of giving a powerful artifact to the villain, its rightful owner, or a kind ghost. The first choice allows the villain to avenge his wife's death, but kills you; the second kills <em>everyone in the world</em>. Technically, even the third is a sub-optimal ending, as the kind ghost has to solve the plot for you. The best ending is achieved by using the artifact yourself (which requires the player to solve one last <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans' data-format='U29sdmVUaGVTb3VwQ2Fucw=='>Solve the Soup Cans</a> puzzle).</li><li> <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasmagoriaAPuzzleOfFlesh' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasmagoriaAPuzzleOfFlesh' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL1BoYW50YXNtYWdvcmlhQVB1enpsZU9mRmxlc2g='>Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh</a></em> lets the player choose whether to remain on Earth, or go off with aliens.

In The Colonel's Bequest, the ending depends on whether you shoot Henri or Rudy. In The Dagger of Amon Ra, you must use clues obtained throughout the game to answer the coroner's questions correctly &#8212; get too many wrong and you'll receive the bad ending, in which pretty much every surviving character comes off much worse off, from losing their job to being brutally murdered. Answering correctly results in a happier ending for all (except the murderer, of course). A third minor ending can also be found if you correctly answer all the questions, but lack the evidence needed to prove your points. The ending leads to a mix of the good and bad endings where everyone is either so-so (with alternative dialogue or fates from the good or bad ends) or still mad at Laura (as they would be in the bad ending). She still ends up killed, however, but the dagger is returned (as opposed to missing in the bad ending).</li><li> <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryI' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryI' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL1F1ZXN0Rm9yR2xvcnlJ'>Quest for Glory I</a></em> gives two endings, which is decided at the Brigand Leader's office. If you don't take the mirror, you will immediately go to the castle to be proclaimed Hero of Spielburg by the Baron, and leave for Shapeir. However, since Baba Yaga remains, the valley remains cursed, and "terror will continue to rule the land". If you do take the mirror, you'll leave through the secret passage and can choose to return to the castle for the bad ending, or deal with Baba Yaga, driving her out of the valley and freeing it of its curse.</li><li> <em><a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVI' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVI' data-format='VmlkZW9HYW1lL0tpbmdzUXVlc3RWSQ=='>King's Quest VI</a></em> has several slight variations on the same ending depending on whether you complete all of the optional tasks, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >befriending Jollo and bringing Cassima's parents <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead' data-format='QmFja0Zyb21UaGVEZWFk'>Back from the Dead</a></span>.
