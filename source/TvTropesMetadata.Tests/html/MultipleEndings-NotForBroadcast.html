Jenny comes into view, and Robyn, Not Patrick, and Megan sit in stunned silence, before wondering what happens now and if they still have jobs. All of them were completely blindsided by Julia taking over the show. Robyn and Not Patrick leave, and Megan worries over the situation, feeling betrayed by both Julia (who she "backed all the way") and Boseman, fearing that she'll be demoted or fired.

She then addresses that people are worried about the underpopulation crisis, and states that the worst is yet to come, with her encouraging the Territories to be closer than ever.

She also states that a small rebel group is trying to reclaim a chunk of Territories 6 and 7, announcing that the consolidation of the community within Territory 1 is put into effect.

Jenny comes into view and tells everyone that they're not being broadcast, and Alex is putting something else out. The unknown footage is displayed in the studio and the six women watch in stunned, horrified silence.</li></ul><em>-bzzt!-</em><ul ><li> The tape displays Julia and her chief scientific officer, Dr. Thomas Wellington, discussing the sterility crisis. There was a scientific experiment involving genetically modifying seeds in order to put contraceptives directly into the food supply. It was meant to be opt-out contraception that would prevent accidental pregnancies. The experiment was supposed to be restricted to Territory 1. However, the crops evolved so quickly that the situation became out of control as the genetically modified material spread across the Territories, becoming embedded in the food chain. They estimate that 70% to 90% of the population will be affected with infertility, and for those that can conceive, most births will be "unviable." Their only chance would be to scorch the land and obtain unaltered seeds and livestock from nations outside the Territories, but they conclude that this is impossible. Julia decides to cover it up, blame the radiation from the nuclear bombs set off during "Liberation Night", and try to convey the positives of a childless life (with how malleable people can be with positivity). In order to prevent the secret from coming out, it is heavily implied that she had everyone who knew about the true cause of the sterility executed via the Transition Centres (minus Dr. Wellington, who she spares because they're "old friends.")</li></ul></p><p><em>-End Tape-</em><ul ><li> Julia desperately tries to cover up what was broadcasted, claiming it was "illegally obtained" and "falsified." The Nightly Show hosts turn against Julia, stating that they had tried having children before. Unable to twist the narrative, Julia denies everything as Megan, Robyn and Not Patrick continue to ask questions relating to the sterility, with Julia refusing to answer these "conspiracy theories". After Julia storms off, Megan starts to apologize to the viewers for what just happened, but then changes course, telling the public that they <em>should</em> be upset and urging them to march to Team HQ for elections and answers. She then apologizes for her role in misleading the public, and proudly declares that you can make tomorrow better.</li><li> After the ads roll, Robyn and Not Patrick think they're all about to be fired, just as Jenny walks in to say that Boseman wants to see everyone. Megan, however, suspects that there's more to the story, considering Boseman is no fan of Advance either. Robyn states that Jeremy would have been proud of them tonight, with Jenny and Megan strongly agreeing.</li><li> The song "There is a Place" plays as the game's credits roll.</li></ul><h2><span class="asscaps" >03. A Brighter Future</span></h2><strong>Public Opinion: <span class="gray" >Irrelevant</span></strong><ul ><li> Megan, having been reinstated as anchor of the National Nightly News (blue studio), reports that Advance have won the latest election in a landslide victory, with Katie Brightman returning for a third term. Brightman is now an extremely popular politician, who initially ran on a ticket of Universal Basic Income and Free Education, and reinstated the independence of the former Territories. For her third term, she has promised to instigate a four-day working week and make the climate emergency a number one priority, declaring the election win "a triumph for democracy and for us all."</li></ul><h3>Tropes</h3><ul ><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding' data-format='Qml0dGVyc3dlZXRFbmRpbmc='>Bittersweet Ending</a>: Yes, Julia is exiled from Advance, her political career in complete ruin, and Katie becomes their new leader, opting to bring the Territories into a <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop' data-format='W1tUaXRsZURyb3AgYnJpZ2h0ZXIgZnV0dXJlXV0='>brighter future</a>.

Jeremy is the second caller - he says he has several questions for the prime minister, then hangs up and appears from backstage, giving Megan a hug and sitting beside her. Jenny returns, having lured away Sarah and locked the studio doors. Jeremy confronts Julia on the millions of deaths she caused by launching the nuclear attack on Liberation Night, and how she fought with Peter Clement in the following weeks. Julia seems to start crying, but Megan notes that there's no tears on her face, and she instantly "recovers" as a Drone of Dread plays and security start pounding on the doors. The trio quickly realizes that they're trapped, with Jeremy clearly terrified of going back to Betterment. Security break in, and as Jeremy surrenders and insists he acted alone, they violently arrest him, slamming him to the ground several times. As he's being taken away, with blood dripping down his face, he begs Alex to play the footage, while Julia threatens to arrest Alex as well if they play it.</li></ul><h1>Donaldson Foiled</h1><strong>Tape Played?: <span class="red" >No</span></strong></p><p><em>-bzzt!-</em><ul ><li> Julia gives a speech to the viewers as the show closes, apologizing for anything upsetting that happened and saying that Jeremy "will be given the best of care in what I'm sorry to say will probably be a long and arduous process of Betterment." She announces that she will be the new main host of the Nightly Show, and that her team will take a look at Jeremy's footage, but that "sometimes it's better not to know." She tells the viewers "Have a peaceful night."</li><li> After the ads roll, Julia scolds Megan and Jenny, but doesn't have them arrested because she says that she understands why they pulled that stunt. Megan says that it won't happen again, and she and Jenny look despondently at the ground in silence. Julia says "good, let's get back to work," and the signal cuts out.</li><li> The song "And When You Fall" plays as the credits roll.</li></ul><h3><span class="asscaps" >04. A Better Jeremy</span></h3><strong>Public Opinion: <span class="teal" >Advance</span></strong><ul ><li> Julia Salisbury, now the host of The Nightly Show, opens the Couch of Chat segment, saying that they'll be discussing cat football, but that first they have a special guest, fresh from Betterment, Jeremy Donaldson. Jeremy enters from behind the curtain, wearing an unusually neat gray suit emblazoned with the Advance logo, with his hair slicked back. He smiles a little too late and a little too brightly, and gives the camera a stiff, exagerrated wave, before walking stiffly over to the couch, nodding to everyone as they greet him, before sitting down across from Megan and Julia. Julia asks how it is being back, and he hesitates slightly before saying "It's <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>SoCo</span>, Julia," then turning to stare at the camera, "Really <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>SoCo</span>." The others laugh, and Megan asks him to give tonight's topic "the old Donaldson spin." He hesitates for a couple seconds, looks at the camera, and says "Our headlines tonight... They think it's all over... It is meow!"

Immediately, the peppy Nightly Show theme starts playing and Julia abruptly moves on to celebrate the high birth numbers. Robyn and Not Patrick cheerfully play along, as the shot cuts to Megan looking at the ground, on the verge of tears.

While watching, Julia starts to cry, for real this time, as everyone else watches in horror.</li></ul><em>-bzzt!-</em><ul ><li> The tape begins explosively with Peter Clement and Julia Salisbury in the midst of a heated argument, as Peter calls Julia out on the nuclear attacks she had carried out on Liberation Night. It is revealed that Peter did not approve of the attacks at all, and Julia had them carried out without his knowledge: had he known, Peter states that he would've gone on the news and exposed her. With Julia resolute that her actions were justified and necessary for the country's future, Peter tells her that he plans to reveal to the entire world what a "fucking monster" she is and storms out. Once she is alone, Julia calls "Adrien at the services" and, describing Peter as a "liability", requests that Adrien carry out the plan they had discussed in regards to the co-Prime Minister and "Make it quick. I don't want him to suffer." Through this, Julia is exposed as having arranged for Peter Clement's assassination.</li></ul><em>-End Tape-</em><ul ><li> Silence comes through the room with the exception of Julia's heavy breathing, before Megan asks the former if she has anything to say. Julia tries to deny it, but Megan shoots that down, saying that it looks like she ordered the murder of Peter Clement. Jenny, finally having enough of Advance's corruption, quits and allows herself to be arrested. After which, Megan asks a furious Julia if she has any more comments. Julia snaps, firing all of Channel One before then deciding that's not enough and orders them all to be arrested. Megan scoffs in disbelief and says that she's not the criminal, and that Julia should be arrested. Julia screams that she's the Prime Minister, but Megan cuts her off, saying that she's not above the law. Seeing her security detail hesitate, Julia screams at them to do their job. They comply, but Megan taunts Julia, saying that her political career is over and gives the audience the incentive to get Julia out of office and get a better government.

Alan James reveals himself, and when questioned about his goals, he states "we're not hear to take out a person; we're cancelling the whole fucking show," as he unzips his jacket to reveal an explosive vest. As Alan forces Julia to confess to her crimes (killing the sound technician Colin in the process), she reveals that she has a secret recording of the Disrupt leadership.

A SWAT team breaks into the studio, but they can't do anything as Alan holds his finger down on a trigger for the explosive device, while holding Megan and Jenny at gunpoint. Jenny calls Alan out for not wanting to watch the footage, saying that the Disrupt leaders are using him and that everyone thinks he's a pathetic joke, causing him to shoot her in anger.

They estimate that they will need to systematically kill millions of people: "the intellectuals, the radicals, the free thinkers, anyone who does not understand and accept the natural order of existence" as well as their friends and family.

Alan tells Jenny to keep the show going and that they won't hurt anyone if they don't have to, though he holds Robyn and Not Patrick at gunpoint. Once the doors are locked and sealed, he gives the unarmed masked man the all clear. The unarmed man unmasks, revealing himself to be Jeremy Donaldson.

He reveals that he analyzed Menu Centre boxes from across the territories and found traces of norethindrone, a type of birth control, and agrobacterium tumefaciens, a bacteria used in genetic modification. Confronted with the evidence, Julia admits that Advance had made what was meant to be opt-out contraception, which went wrong in the testing phase, leading to the sterility crisis. She justifies it by saying that the population was growing at an unsustainable rate and that it would have resulted in wars over fuel, food and water within 50 years, had she not taken action to create a "sustainable future." Megan is outraged, because she tried so many times to have children with her wife. Alan calls for elections to be unsuspended, leading Jeremy to turn to interview him next. As Jenny cues up the unknown footage, he asks Alan who he takes orders from. Alan refuses to say, and Jeremy reveals that he has met with Disrupt's leadership, once when he was a news anchor and again a week prior to now.

Jeremy ends the show with Megan's catchphrase, "Let's make tomorrow better."</li><li> After the ads roll, Julia storms out, saying she'll call Boseman. Alan says they're apparently free to go, but Jeremy refuses to come with him. He remarks, "I wouldn't vote for your party, Mr James. Or hers. Who knows, maybe I'll run as an independent." Alan remarks that Jeremy's too honest for politics before leaving. Jeremy thanks Megan for "letting [him] ruin her awful show" and she says she hopes the new talk show format won't be around for long after tonight. They hug, and she tells him to book in advance next time he wants to come on the news before she leaves. After that, Jeremy and Jenny leave to go out to dinner together.</li><li> The song "Take a Little Time" plays as the game's credits roll.</li></ul><h2><span class="asscaps" >11. A Renewed Mandate</span></h2><strong>Public Opinion: <span class="teal" >Advance</span></strong><ul ><li> Megan appears as anchor of the National Nightly News (blue studio) and reports that since Prime Minister Julia Salisbury's landslide election six months prior, she has used her powerful mandate to deliver on many campaign promises. Advance's "<span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>CoT</span>" has been processing a backlog of membership applications to the Territories, and the former nation of Malvalia has just been approved as Territory 34, the second new territory in two months. She starts to report on cultural news ("punk rock bellringers") before the video cuts off.</li></ul><h3>Tropes</h3><ul ><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding' data-format='QW1iaWd1b3VzRW5kaW5n'>Ambiguous Ending</a>: It's hard to tell how exactly things are going in this ending.

The Middle Ground</span></h2><strong>Public Opinion: Neutral</strong><ul ><li> Megan appears as anchor of the National Nightly News (blue studio), reporting on the day before the election. Opinion polls predict a record turnout and that no one party will have a majority, likely leading to a Coalition government, which Megan hopes will lead to some much-needed moderation. She says she'll be talking to Political Analyst Lisa Andrews and to Robyn Shorte, reporting live from a polling station. The blue studio title sequence plays, with clips of Megan replacing Jeremy's parts. As the Patrick Bannon clip plays, the video cuts off.</li></ul><h3>Tropes</h3><ul ><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding' data-format='QW1iaWd1b3VzRW5kaW5n'>Ambiguous Ending</a>: This ending ends one day before the faithful election. Although considering that neither Advance nor Disrupt will claim the majority, we'll never know what happens beyond this point.</li></ul><h2><span class="asscaps" >13. Under New Management</span></h2><strong>Public Opinion: <span class="cinnamon" >Disrupt</span></strong><ul ><li> Megan appears as anchor of the National Nightly News (blue studio), reporting that this will be Channel One's last broadcast. Disrupt leadership has allowed them a last farewell, and Megan says, with obvious disdain, that <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>DisruptTV</span> will broadcast its first programming tomorrow, including such offerings as "Benefit Scroungers and the Undeserving Poor" and "One Nation News MAX" where Chett Blaze will be asking "How many guns is enough?" She thanks the viewers one last time, and with her voice shaking slightly, tells them good night, and good luck. A credits sequence starts to play over a freeze frame, before the Disrupt logo appears, followed by the words "<span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>DisruptTV</span>: What Freedom Looks Like," with the beginning of "Take a Little Time" playing in the background.</li></ul><h3>Tropes</h3><ul ><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding' data-format='RG93bmVyRW5kaW5n'>Downer Ending</a>: Disrupt's plans, motivations and funding are never revealed to the public, and as a result of this and their popularity, they win the election. Channel One is shut down, replaced by <span class='esc-seq' title='non-wikiword'>DisruptTV</span>, a right wing propaganda outlet. Alan James's promise of a free press turns out to be an empty one. The Disrupt leadership's plan to return to the "Natural Order" is presumably successful, and they may even begin their <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge' data-format='W1tUaGVQdXJnZSAic2FuaXRpc2F0aW9uIl1d'>"sanitisation"</a> process as discussed in Path C's footage.</li><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDeath' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDeath' data-format='TmV0d29ya0RlYXRo'>Network Death</a>: In-universe; Channel One is shut down by the new Disrupt-run government.</li></ul><h1>Disrupt Unmasked</h1><strong>Tape Played?: <span class="green" >Yes</span></strong><ul ><li> Jenny says Alex played the footage and Jeremy has it broadcast into the studio.</li></ul></p><p><em>-bzzt!-</em><ul ><li> The tape is a button camera recording of Jeremy sitting at a table with Disrupt's leaders: Ivan Vodovich, Foreign Minister of Irkistan; former Prime Minister Jacob Hamilton-Mann, General Jefferson Masters, and Viscount Piers Antony Gaviston-Ridley. As Jeremy questions them, they reveal that their research uncovered the sterilisation plot and they want Jeremy rather than Alan James to reveal it to the public, since Alan is a "rabble-rouser" but Jeremy is "a face they trust." They anticipate civil unrest and riots afterward, followed by the restoration of elections, under Disrupt's control. "Nature abhors a vacuum. You, Mr Donaldson, will create that vacuum. And we shall be there to fill it." Jeremy asks how they plan to do this if Advance took all of their wealth. The leaders reveal connections to illicit drug markets, child sex traffickers, and foreign powers, giving them the funds "to fight and to win." Afterward, they plan to restore the "Natural Order." "Strict order. An end to ungodly acts. Everyone back in their place." They reveal their disdain for Alan James, who they consider part of the "low orders." The clip ends as the leaders toast.</li></ul><em>-End Tape-</em></p><p><ul ><li> Alan accuses Jeremy of setting him up, and he and Julia argue briefly, while Megan criticizes them, "Pathetic. Neither of you recognise your own reflection." Jenny reveals that security has been waiting outside, but they're not doing anything because they saw the reveal of the sterilisation plot and many of them wanted children. Jeremy and Megan close out the night together, saying that elections should be held soon, and the public can choose to be equal under Advance "like performing lions," free under Disrupt "to struggle and starve," or they can choose a third option. They encourage the public to stand up, take responsibility, choose something different. They end the show, "Have a transformative night," "And then make tomorrow better."</li><li> After the ads roll, Julia threatens to shut down the channel, while Alan remarks, "We're done. They got us both." Jenny says Julia's security team can escort her out, while she offers to call a taxi for Alan, who wonders where he would even go. Jeremy asks if he's under arrest, and Julia says "I think you know you've made that impossible, Mr Donaldson," before leaving. Alan says "My bosses won't be pleased with you," as he leaves. Jeremy remarks, "Child sex traffickers and wannabe dictators. They're the natural enemies of the reporter." Jeremy, Megan, and Jenny decide to go see Boseman together, and Jeremy jokes that they should burn this set afterward.</li><li> The song "Smart" plays as the game's credits roll.</li></ul><h2><span class="asscaps" >14. An Accord</span></h2><strong>Public Opinion: <span class="gray" >Irrelevant</span></strong><ul ><li> Jeremy Donaldson and Megan Wolfe appear as co-anchors of the National Nightly News (red studio, used on Day 1 and Day 8). They report that the new Centrist party Accord has just won the election. Advance and Disrupt did not even get ten percent of the vote. The new Prime Minister, Fatima Chowdhury, called Accord's win "proof that the major parties had lost the trust of the nation" and signaled "the end of extremist politics."</li></ul><h3>Tropes</h3><ul ><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds' data-format='Qm9va0VuZHM='>Bookends</a>: In this ending, the game both begins and ends with Jeremy Donaldson (alongside Megan Wolfe, the second time around) reporting in the National Nightly News red studio on the day after a new party comes to power with a shocking election win.</li><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding' data-format='RWFybllvdXJIYXBweUVuZGluZw=='>Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: A lot of the good characters have suffered a lot to get to this point, but it's all worth it in the end.</li><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding' data-format='R29sZGVuRW5kaW5n'>Golden Ending</a>: While Liberation Night and the Uprising have their casualties, this ending is the best if you want the main characters to survive the seven years of horror in the Territories. Jeremy and Alan survive, Advance and Disrupt are exposed, a new centrist party paves the way for a better future, and overall, everything ends on a hopeful note.<ul ><li> Though there are several endings which show the National Nightly News restored to its previous state, this is the <em>only</em> one where <em>Jeremy</em> is back at the anchor desk where he belongs, and the return of his hard-hitting tone is signified by the restoration to the original red studio as opposed to the watered-down blue studio (along with Megan mentioning that he's back to reporting on real news stories once again).</li><li> In fact, if you really want to add a nice and polished shine, keeping your family alive and making as many celebrities successful and happy by the end can ultimately make the ending much better and rewarding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption' data-format='VGFrZUFUaGlyZE9wdGlvbg=='>Take a Third Option</a>: The entire point of this ending.
