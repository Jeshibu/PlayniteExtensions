            <p></p><p>Survival Horror games tend to feature at least two different possible endings depending on the players' choice of decisions and actions throughout the gameplay. Bad endings usually lead to the death of <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter' data-format='UGxheWVyQ2hhcmFjdGVy'>Player Character</a> (and sometimes <a class='twikilink' href='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions' title='/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions' data-format='VHJ1ZUNvbXBhbmlvbnM='>True Companions</a>).

In the bad ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >you escape but the killer is safe and people in the future are not</span>.

The "bad" ending occurs if either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >Daniel doesn't escape the cell or he allows Alexander to go through the portal.

Eventually, they find an alternate route outside and escape together. The ending has Takuro and Hiroshi reflecting on events, hoping it was all a bad dream, while Takeshi has a nightmare about the Oni killing him. The final segment of the ending has a new group enter the house, the camera cutting to outside when the Oni appears.
