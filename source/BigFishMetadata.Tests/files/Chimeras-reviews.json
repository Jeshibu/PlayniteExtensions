The story was insensible, the collectables were way too easy to find, the hops were ok. The mini games were either too easy or came with iffy instructions. The map was not reliable for available actions. you are forced to hear characters speak before you can examine a scene. Repeated use of tropes like missing zipper pulls made it a bit tedious.

This one not so much. Trial was okay which is why i bought it. (on sale) but then it got ridiculous with cliches and objects that are just plain silly. No beepers and batteries like that in the 1940s. You can't just pick up an item. you have to wait until you find a trowel to pick up an item sticking out of the ground. Of course, the broken zippers are everywhere along with the drawer handles. Also must melt down iron to make a key while there is a gun pointed at you. It was so silly. Very disappointed. \r\nThe whole plot made no sense. Revenge for what???\r\nLots of matching of symbols...I don't like that personally. I think it's kind of when the creators gave up and needed to extend the game.\r\nI normally love the Chimera games. The graphics were good. As usual. But I wish I could get my money back. I played the whole thing just waiting for it to get better or to at least make sense. Neither ever happened. \r\nCollectables were a bit WAY too easy. Thats half the fun for me. \r\nIt wasn't terrible. So much potential wasted on mediocrity. \r\nI haven't played the bonus yet.

This one was more like playing a paranormal files game in that the character images along with the background images were not like the brilliant, and beautiful scenes like the original chimeras. The lion is on his own in this one. The goat and dragon, who were the extensions to the lion, were severed off. Why have hos with no instructions? The hos were mostly shadow figures which were difficult in most cases to figure out. There is way too much dialog. I could not grasp what the story line led up to. Why trap all these people, have a triangle love affair and numerous assignations attempts only to have those be a ploy to deceive whoever? I usually play the trials before I buy a game, should have stuck to my routine.

Could this be The Sign of Prophecy, Heavenfall Secrets, or just the Price of Greed? Could it be our Inhuman Nature attracting us with Blinding Love towards these Cherished Serpents? Will they bear the Mark of Death? Will they be singing to the Tune of Revenge as if defying Mortal Medicine, or will they simply be Cursed and Forgotten? Can The Lost Film resurface from the foul depths of the Wailing Waters to form a New Rebellion...there's only one way to find out!\r\n\r\nI'm on the fence with this one.\r\n\r\nIt does feel like the developers at Elephant Games put some thought into the gameplay and tried to implement a Retro\/Progressive aspect. \r\n\r\nI Lost My Film...\r\nThe storyline didn't blow me away, but nonetheless, it was interesting enough to hold my attention throughout the demo. My biggest issue was forming a connection with the characters. I felt there were too many similar characters introduced right from the start,\u00c2\u00a0making it difficult to connect with any of them.\r\n\r\nThey did a good job incorporating some retro aspects into the Hidden Object Scenes. In an effort to make the HOs more challenging, I think they may have missed the mark a bit because the scenes have areas where some objects are obscured by others, and there's no indication that something can be interacted with. With that being said, they added some nice throwback variations we haven't seen in a while, such as finding and dragging four items to the inventory bar to open up four different lists. I must admit that I enjoyed the scene where you had to select 2 related objects that, when combined, would create the \"listed\" object, such as\u00c2\u00a0 __ + __ = ?.\r\n\r\nThe Plot Thickens...\r\n\u00c2\u00a0I will admit that it's a better game than some recent Elephant games, BUT clearly they are trying to revitalize the \"IT FACTOR\" they once had by bringing back games from the older series, like Chimeras and the upcoming Royal Detective.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that they still believe we simply missed the older series games because of sentimental reasons. They fail to understand\u00c2\u00a0that games like Chimeras: Tune of Revenge received a 4.7 average rating from 127 reviewers because it had a great story, amazing graphics, awesome features, and interesting game mechanics.\r\n\r\nThey refuse to accept the fact that they have essentially dumbed down the gameplay recently with cookie-cutter features. They abolished the free-roaming adventure aspect and made their games practically fool-proof! (while slicing the CE Extras to bare bones, I might add) They even slated the infamous Morphing Objects...a feature that no other developer was quite able to replicate (well, with the exception of Blue Tea games)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00a0I can't help but wonder if this new generation of developers has even bothered to play any of the classic Elephant Games that created their fan base in the first place, such as Tune of Revenge, Mystery Trackers: The Void, or Royal Detective: The Lord of Statues? I have my doubts because if they had, they would know exactly what the IT FACTOR was, and why IT is missing\u00c2\u00a0 now!\r\n\r\nSwing by the woods forum dot boards dot net and share your thoughts.","nickname":"pennmom36","like_about":null,"not_like_about":null,"guest_email":null,"plus_review":"2","minus_review":"0","rating_votes":[{"vote_id":5129448,"option_id":37,"rating_id":7,"review_id":4342956,"percent":60,"value":3,"rating_code":"Overall Rating","__typename":"RatingVote"}],"images":[],"comments":[],"__typename":"Review"},{"review_id":4342944,"created_at":"2025-09-25 19:01:25","answer":null,"verified_buyer":0,"is_recommended":true,"detail_id":5326041,"title":"Boring","detail":"I don't know what's happened to Elephant Games developers but their games have not been the same since Covid.
