    Changelog:
    - Turned plugin into a metadata source. This lets the tag fetching be integrated into the post-import metadata fetching. But, since there is no metadata merging in Playnite, this is exclusive with other tag sources (for example itch.io). The existing post-import tag fetching (which does merge with any existing tags) is still available, unchanged.
    - Added option to pick tag language
    - Added option to tag delisted games
