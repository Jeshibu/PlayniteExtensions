    Changelog:
      - "Transitioned to MobyGames API v2 (v1 is deactivated as far as I can tell)"

      - "Only one request per 5 seconds can be made now, as opposed to 1 per second."
      - "Bulk property import is limited to fetching 10 games every 5 seconds. I've discussed this with their developer and he's indicated this page size will be increased in the future, at which point I'll update this plugin again."
      - "And finally, API use is now exclusive to students, academic researchers, and paying subscribers ($10 a month minimum at time of writing) - see the API subscription options (and find a link to apply for a free API key) at https://www.mobygames.com/api/subscribe/"
